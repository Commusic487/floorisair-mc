# Floor is Air Auxiliaries Update Log

## Version 1.2

> Multi-language Update

### Multi-language

Starting from this version, players are suggested to use a translation resource pack provided in order to enjoy the game with different languages.

Without the resource pack installed, players can still play the game normally but only English is available to them.

This feature does not require additional server changes but only clients.

However, server owners are suggested to make the translation pack as the default and required resource pack when player joins the game.

### General changes

- Some language glitches are fixed in order to improve the text clarity.
- _Firework_ is now renamed into _rocket_.
- _Dead block_ and related items are renamed into _Death block_.

### Technical changes

- Two unused functions from the past have been deleted.

## Version before 1.2
Update logs are missing.
